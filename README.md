This repo holds all our standard functions that all our services should use. We include a folder for each language -- files are broken down by their inclusion method. Please follow our [development best practices](https://foundation.aninix.net/AniNIX/Wiki/src/branch/master/Operation/Development_Best_Practices.md) when contributing.

These functions are not intended to be invoked directly, so the package created from this repo will only provide files on disk.
